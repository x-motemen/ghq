== NAME

ghq - Manage remote repository clones

== DESCRIPTION

'ghq' provides a way to organize remote repository clones, like +go get+ does. When you clone a remote repository by +ghq get+, ghq makes a directory under a specific root directory (by default +~/.ghq+) using the remote repository URL's host and path.

    $ ghq get https://github.com/motemen/ghq
    # Runs `git clone https://github.com/motemen/ghq ~/.ghq/github.com/motemen/ghq`

You can also list local repositories (+ghq list+), jump into local repositories (+ghq look+), and bulk cloning repositories from several web services (+ghq import+).

== SYNOPSIS

[verse]
'ghq' get [-u] <repository URL> | <user>/<project>
'ghq' list [-p] [-e] [<query>]
'ghq' look <project> | <user>/<project> | <host>/<user>/<project>
'ghq' import starred [-u] <user>
'ghq' import pocket [-u]

== COMMANDS

get::
    Clone a GitHub repository under ghq root directory. See
    <<directory-structures,DIRECTORY STRUCTURES>> below. If the repository is
    already cloned to local, nothing will happen unless '-u' ('--update')
    flag is supplied, in which case 'git remote update' is executed. +
    If there are multiple +ghq.root+ 's, existing local clones are searched
    first. Then a new repository clone is created under the primary root if
    none is found. +
    Currently supports GitHub and Google Code Project (Git/Mercurial) repositories.

list::
    List locally cloned repositories. If a query argument is given, only
    repositories whose names contain that query text are listed. '-e'
    ('--exact') forces the match to be an exact one (i.e. the query equals to
    _project_ or _user_/_project_) If '-p' ('--full-path') is given, the full paths
    to the repository root are printed instead of relative ones.

look::
    Look into a locally cloned repository with the shell.

import starred::
    Retrieves GitHub repositories that are starred by the user specified and
    performs 'get' for each of them.

import pocket::
    Retrieves http://getpocket.com/[Pocket] entries of github.com and
    performs 'get' for each of them. +
    To use this, needs to be compiled with Pocket consumer key. See <<installing,INSTALLING>>.

== CONFIGURATION

Configuration uses 'git-config' variables.

ghq.root::
    The path to directory under which cloned repositories are placed. See
    <<directory-structures,DIRECTORY STRUCTURES>> below. Defaults to +~/.ghq+. +
    This variable can have multiple values. If so, the first one becomes
    primary one i.e. new repository clones are always created under it. You may
    want to specify "$GOPATH/src" as a secondary root (environment variables
    should be expanded.)

ghq.ghe.host::
    The hostname of your GitHub Enterprise installation. A repository that has a
    hostname set with this key will be regarded as same one as one on GitHub.
    This variable can have multiple values. If so, the first one that is matched
    becomes primary one.

== [[directory-structures]]DIRECTORY STRUCTURES

Local repositories are placed under 'ghq.root' with named github.com/_user_/_repo_.
